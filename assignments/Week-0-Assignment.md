# Assignment - Week 0
Ok, so we learnt about Formal languages last week. Formal languages are also called,
**Formal Grammer** and is one of the fundamental bricks in building any Programming language.

Understanding the rules of a formal language and learning to express one's thoughts in it, is an essential skill for any programmer. This assignment would be focusing on various formal languages and you would have to work on expressing yourself using them.

# 1. Chess game app:
*Level: Intermediate*

You are building a chess game website for players all around the globe to come and play against each other. You and your team has designed the chess board with pieces arranged in the starting positions. The next job for your team is to connect the screens of any two players in such a way that, when one player makes a move, the move is reflected on the screen of the other player.

Your software team decides to make each move by any player be represented as a string of characters and be transmitted over the internet and then on the other player's screen this string would be deciphered and the chess board will be updated. so Your task is to use ["algebraic notation"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)) in chess and interpret the following moves.

Express each move in algebraic notation.

B)

C)

# 2. Find and fix the semantic errors in the statements below:
*Level: Beginner*

A) You write a code to find the area of a circle. The pseudocode is as follows:

    ```
    get radius
    compute area = (pi * radius) ** 2
    print(area)
    ```

B) Find the average of two numbers in python

    ```
    a = 5
    b = 7
    avg = a + b / 2
    print(avg)
    ```

C) Check if a basic trigonometry idiom is correct.

    ```
    x = 30
    y = sine(x)
    z = cosine(x)
    if (y + z ) ** 2 is equal to 1
      then print("Yes, trigonometry is right")
    otherwise
      t
# 3 pseudocode exercise
*Level: Intermediate*

Pseudocode is expressing a solution as a set of formal sentences, without use of any programming language. Write in logical steps, how you will solve the following problem:

Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?

Extras:

a)  If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
b)  Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.

# 4. Set theory:
*Level: Intermediate*

Set is a list of elements, like a set of cards defines all playing cards.

Among many, the basic set theory deals with these symbols: `{}`, `∪`, `∩`, `-`, and `not()`

Lets take 3 of these symbols:
`{}`: Used to represent a set of elements. Eg. A = {1,2,3,4} represents all integers from 1 to 4 inclusive.
`∪`: Union of two sets, eg: `A ∪ B` is the set of all elements that
are in A, or B, or both.
`∩`: intersection of two sets, eg: `A ∩ B` is the set of all elements that
are in both A and B.

A) Find the union of these two sets X = {1, 4, 9, 16}, Y = {1, 4, 20, 84}
B) Find the intersection of these two sets X = {1, 4, 9, 16}, Y = {1, 4, 20, 84}
C) Find the intersection of these two sets X = {1, 4, 9, 16}, Y = {1, 4, 20, 84}

# 5. The mine craft programming game:
*Level: Beginner
Type: Visual programming*

Head over to [https://studio.code.org/s/hero/stage/1/puzzle](https://studio.code.org/s/hero/stage/1/puzzle)
You will be presented with an Hour long exercise to help some minecraft characters escape from a bad situation. To submit an answer, you can take the screenshot of the last stage you played.
