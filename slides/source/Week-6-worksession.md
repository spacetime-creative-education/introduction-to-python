**Problem-1**

_level: easy_

*Define a function which returns a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and n (both included), and the values are square of keys. Note, `n` is taken as an argument to the function. Call the function with n=5, and print the results*

**Problem-2**

_level: tricky_

*Unique list*

write a function that consumes a list of numbers and returns a list on only unique numbers from that list.

hint: what did we see this week?

Sample output:
```python
>>> l = [1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4]
>>> unique(l)
[1,2,3,4]
```

**Problem-3**

_level: challenging_

*True purple rain*

We tried and implemented "Purple rain" by Daniel Shiffman, using random numbers. But now we know more, we know `global` variables, and we know `dict`. Use these two pieces to make the rain, obey gravity and flow in a layered fashion.
