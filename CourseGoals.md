1. Develop essential coding skills through python
2. Solve problems by building solutions based on blocks of codes
3. Learn to read and write "good" python
4. Write readable code that other programmers understand
(Repeat after me! Programmer is more important than the program)


For the instructor:- What is the goal for the takeaways that an ideal student would get?

1. By the end of the course, a programmer attitude needs to be set
    Programmer mindset: 
    a. Read lots of code
    b. Read and depend on documentation, no need to know code snippets by heart
    c. It isn't about the number of lines of code you write, the game is to solve a problem, in the "best" possible. What's best you ask? that depends on the project. Mostly, its Quick prototyping and MVP, writing readable code, sometimes its performance and speed.
2. Learn entire synax, best practises and philosophy of python programming
3. Take up 3rd party libraries and explore them independantly

Who is this class designed for?
1. Someone who knows a bit of programming, in any language, one who understands what's an `if` statement, 
what `loops` are. Beyond that you not know much about the nuances of coding, this class will prepare you for that.
